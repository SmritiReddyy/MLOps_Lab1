# MLOps_Lab1

To ensure that this lab submission is not identical to the base repository provided by the instructor, i made the following changes:

- Added a new calculator function `fun5(x, y)` to perform division with proper input validation and division-by-zero handling.
- Extended the **Pytest** test suite to include test cases for the newly added division function.
- Extended the **Unittest** test suite to validate the new function using class-based test cases.
- Verified that all tests pass successfully both locally and through GitHub Actions CI workflows.
